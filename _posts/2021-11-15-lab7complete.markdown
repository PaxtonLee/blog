## Lab 7 Finished
Lab 7, although I should have finished it much sooner, was probably my favorite
this semester. The tutorial was fairly easy right up until the step where I had
to add another field to my model for movies. In the end, though, I got it all
figured out. I feel as though I'd be much more confident making more Razor applications in the future. I found it to be much more customize-able on the
surface than the Jekyll framework.

The [Github](https://github.com/PaxtonLee/csci340lab7) repository 
for my own model shows a list of my favorite video games.
