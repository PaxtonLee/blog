## Lab 5 Finished
This lab was very interesting. I've been enjoying visualizing these data models in class, so I was excited to put that experience to work here.
I'm certain that I've probably overlooked some small detail on one of these graphs despite triple checking, but if need be, I can go back and fix them later.

For now, here are the .png files from LucidChart and Vertabelo:
![lucidchart](./images/lucidchart.png)
![vertabelo](./images/vertabelo.png)

Markdown seems to be having trouble displaying the images, but you can find them in my github repository for this project.
I'll see if I can fix it in the morning, but for now, I'm going to bed.
