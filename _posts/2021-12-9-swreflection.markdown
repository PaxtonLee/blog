## SW Reflection
The major portion of the SW credit from this course comes from the
process of working with an outside-of-class client in order to develop a product.
This product can then be deployed and utilized by multiple users which the client
is aiming to assist in some way.

Personally, I believe that we Computer Science students are incredibly fortunate
to be able to work with software like Github to make collaboration easy
(sometimes). I also believe that introducing a similar tool for students in other
fields of study to use and help share data is something that every discipline of
study should have access to. While I firmly believe that, with sufficient time,
our solution could be just that for GIS students, I know that half of one semester
is not a realistic timeframe for us to create a tool of that calibur using software
and programming tools which none of us are familiar with. That said, with the
time and experience we were working with, the rest of my group and I are proud of
what we were able to produce. We hope that it can be built upon and utilized for
many classes to come after our own.

The collaboration which this project required is a valuable skill when it comes
to providing social change work such as developing this website or sharing data
with other students as part of a GIS project. Overall, I believe our methods are
an effective starting point in facilitaing the collaboration between colleagues
who are working in similar fields. It isn't perfect, but with some more time and
experience, I genuinely believe that it can be done in any discipline or field
of study. I'm unsure as to whether or not my values were necesasrily challenged
during the development of this project, but my resolve certainly was. I won't
go into great detail about the errors that kept hindering my progress, but the
mental strain that they introduced (especially at the end) was more than I
initially bargained for. Overall, I would say that my resolve when it comes to
working as part of a team on a project like this was strengthened by this
experience.
