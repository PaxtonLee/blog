## Introduction Post: 9-15-21
This post marks my completion of Lab 4: Jekyll Styling. My biggest struggle was overthinking how to get the link to the course webpage into my navbar. That aside, this lab only took me about 40 minutes to complete - which is baffling compared to pretty much EVERY other computer science lab I've done.

I'm supposed to add two links and two images in this post, so in the spirit of our first swim meet, I'll link to the [Men's](https://hendrixwarriors.com/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving) and [Women's](https://hendrixwarriors.com/sports/womens-swimming-and-diving) Swimming and Diving pages.

Now for the images, here are some pictures related to the team.
