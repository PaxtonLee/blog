## Introduction Post: 9-15-21
If all went as planned, this post should be visible from my blog hosted on Github pages. The experience with setting up this website was pretty straightforward, the only roadblock I hit was having to run "bundle install" a second time to make sure Ruby had everything it needed for me to run the jekyll serve command.
The things that I still need to work out now are:
1. Using a different template for the blog, so I don't have to keep using minima
2. Review the rest of the Markdown cheat sheet
3. Survive swim practice tonight so I can keep working on things

I'm not sure what links to put on here just yet, so I'll just link the github repo for this project and my voice acting demo.
